# Gesture-Controlled-Wheelchair
This repository contains an arduino cpp code and a python code for a hand gesture controlled wheelchair.
This presents an enhanced hand gesture-controlled system for unmanned hospital wheelchairs, integrating obstacle avoidance and Bluetooth communication. Computer vision techniques interpret hand 
gestures captured bya webcam, enabling intuitive navigation for patients with limited motor abilities. Ultrasonic sensors detect obstacles, ensuring safe movement adjustments. Bluetooth facilitates 
wireless data transmission to an Arduino microcontroller, executing motor commands. The system enhances patient autonomy and safety, representing a significant advancement in mobility assistance 
within healthcare facilities.
